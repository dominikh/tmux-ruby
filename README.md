# Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want
  to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit
  by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
